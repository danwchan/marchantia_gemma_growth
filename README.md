# Optimizing the growth of gemma in *Marchantia polymorpha*

This project is two-fold:

1. To reanalyze previous data as it relates to media composition (and other growth conditions) and gemma production
2. To replicate these findings using the Cam-1 strain under axenic growth conditions

## Re-analysis of Voth 1941 and 1940

The following investigated gemma production in *M. polymorpha* using a system where plants were grown in specialized containers where liquid media could be changed on their rizoids every other day:

1. Voth PD. Gemmae-Cup Production in Marchantia polymorpha and Its Response to Calcium Deficiency and Supply of Other Nutrients. *Botanical Gazette*. 1941;103(2):310-325. [doi:10.1086/335044][1]
2. Voth PD, Hamner KC. Responses of Marchantia polymorpha to Nutrient Supply and Photoperiod. *Botanical Gazette*. 1940;102(1):169-205. [doi:10.1086/334943][2]

The R scripts in this project reanalyze the data in this table. Analysis can also be found in the [OSF sub-project][4].

## Replication

Since the [OpenPlant][3] collaboration uses the CAM-1 and Cam-2 isolates of *M. polymorpha* we would like to confirm the Voth findings in axenically propiagated samples of this strain as well as in a growth system which is more similar to the agar-based growth which is commonly used in modern experimental set-ups.
